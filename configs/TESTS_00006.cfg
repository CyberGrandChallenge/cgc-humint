#KPRCA_00001
#We just changed the definitions for the tokens 
# that are already in the CB
#We could also change the size of the buffer - but the problem is that
# we will need to calculate the new POV, meaning
# we will have to add in a new calculation type
# that combines a calculation (exec in python?) with a reference
# e.g. BUF_SIZE = 256, then OVERFLOW_STR = "a"*(BUF_SIZE / 3 * 4 - 1) and
#    then have a <REPLACEME>OVERFLOW_STR</REPLACEME> in the pov
