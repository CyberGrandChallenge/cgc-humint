# Had to change the messages so that the tokens (messages) do not overlap
# For example, machine.py reads in the \n first and then does another read
# for Welcome to Palindrome Finder\n and then later finishes reading the 
# last \n using another read, delim. In this case, 3 (or 2 since \n is repeated)
# tokens should be used instead of just one

#define HI "\nWelcome to Palindrome Finder\n\n"
